# Send HTTPS request

Sending HTTP/HTTPS requests is a common task in application development, in this turorial we will show you how to send HTTPS requests.

## Prerequisites

Prepare a HTML to execute:

```html title="index.html"
<html>
<head>
  <title>Send HTTPS request</title>
  <script type="module" src="./main.ts"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## Using `fetch` API

Now you could write your `main.ts` to send HTTPS request:

```typescript title="main.ts"
(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  const json = await response.json();
  console.log(json);
})();
```

If you are a Web developer, and have experience with `fetch` API, you will find it is the same as in the browser.

## Run the code

Now you can run the code in a JSAR environment such as _Play WebXR_, and you will see the response in the console.

```
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```
