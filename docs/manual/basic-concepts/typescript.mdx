# TypeScript

In JSAR, TypeScript is the default programming language, so you need to understand some basic TypeScript concepts.

## Why Choose TypeScript

In the 3D spatial development field, object relationships are more complex. Therefore, type checking is essential for JavaScript. TypeScript, as a superset of JavaScript, provides type checking, allowing us to discover errors earlier in the development process, thus improving development efficiency. Additionally, TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript means that it supports JavaScript as well, making it a good choice for developers who may not want to use TypeScript.

## TypeScript Basics

If you are new to TypeScript, you can learn the basics of TypeScript on the [TypeScript official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). This section will not go into detail on TypeScript basics.

## Using TypeScript in XSML

In XSML, you can use TypeScript by adding a `<script>` tag to your XSML document.

```html
<script src="./main.ts"></script>
```

Then, create a `main.ts` file with the following content:

```typescript
const scene = spatialDocument.scene as BABYLON.Scene;
```

For specific usage examples, you can refer to the API section in the [runtime](./runtime) documentation.
