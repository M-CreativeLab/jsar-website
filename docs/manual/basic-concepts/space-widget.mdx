# Space Mini-Apps

This section will introduce space widgets and related fundamental concepts.

## Space

In the context of augmented reality (AR), a space refers to an area in the real world, which can be a flat surface or a three-dimensional object. Users interact with space widgets to obtain information about the space, such as its size, position, rotation, and more. In AR application development, a scene is typically used to represent and encapsulate a space.

For instance, in the YodaOS-Master system, the system desktop (as shown in the image above) is a space. Users can see a series of virtual screens arranged in the space, and there may also be independent objects within the space. All of these elements collectively constitute the desktop space.

## Degrees of Freedom (DoF)

In the field of augmented reality and virtual reality, the term "degrees of freedom" (DoF) is often used to describe the level of realism in a space. Higher degrees of freedom indicate a more realistic space.

In general, the movement of an object in space can be described in terms of position and rotation. Position includes the offset along the X, Y, and Z axes, while rotation involves the angles of rotation around these axes (pitch, yaw, and roll). Therefore, when an object moves in space, it exhibits changes in position and orientation. The number of parameters used to describe these changes is referred to as degrees of freedom (DoF).

### 0 DoF

0 DoF (Zero Degree of Freedom) refers to a space where the observer has a fixed viewpoint and cannot move or change their perspective.

### 3 DoF

3 DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom) refers to a space where the observer has three degrees of freedom, typically related to the space's orientation.

In virtual spaces, if a camera or observer only changes its orientation while maintaining a fixed position, the space is said to have 3 DoF. This means that objects within the virtual space can move programmatically, but the observer's position remains fixed, and they observe the virtual space from different orientations.

### 6 DoF

6 DoF (Six Degrees of Freedom) refers to a space where the observer has six degrees of freedom, including both position and orientation.

In virtual spaces, if a camera or observer can change both its position and orientation, the space is said to have 6 DoF. The observer can freely move and rotate within the space, providing a high level of realism.

## Embeddable Spaces

So, what are embeddable spaces, also known as subspaces?

An embeddable space, or subspace, is a complete space containing objects that can be embedded within another space as a component. This allows us to:

- Move, rotate, and scale the embedded space within the parent space.
- Interact with objects within the embedded space directly.
- Combine multiple embedded spaces within a parent space to create more complex spatial experiences.

The key technical challenge in embeddable spaces is how to embed one space (a standalone application) into another space (the main application) without interfering with the main application's operation. This is referred to as space safety. In a sense, it's similar to:

1. Different web pages running in the same web browser without interfering with each other, demonstrating browser security.
2. Multiple windows operating on the same screen in a windowing system, where each window does not disrupt the others, demonstrating windowing system security.

These are the basic concepts of embeddable spaces and space widgets.

## Space Mini-Apps

Now that we understand the concepts of space and embeddable spaces, it becomes easy to grasp the concept of space widgets. Space mini-apps are the technology solution for developing embeddable spaces. In the image at the top of this page, the blue rectangular area represents the part of the space widget (JSAR) that developers want to embed within the main space. This widget could be an alarm clock, a calendar, a comic book, a rubber duck, and more.
