# Publishing and Distribution

JSAR Spatial Mini-Apps support various distribution methods, including:

- Distributing through the Rokid AR Store to Rokid AR Studio devices (recommended).
- Publishing as a traditional web service through Github, Npm, or other custom services. Users can access it in the following ways:
  - Accessing it online through JSAR's provided traditional web browser access.
  - Scanning a QR code through the JSAR Canary app on Rokid AR Studio devices.

JSAR Canary is an independent spatial app released by the JSAR team within Rokid AR Studio (which means it is not in the desktop space). It provides a preview of the latest JSAR runtime features. Users can scan a QR code to access any XSML document and initialize it in the spatial environment.

> JSAR Canary is for developer preview purposes only. The runtime environment is different from the desktop space mini-app environment. If you need to publish your mini-app to the Rokid Store, please use the desktop space mini-app in Rokid AR Studio for preview and debugging, and follow the official submission and publication process for the store.
