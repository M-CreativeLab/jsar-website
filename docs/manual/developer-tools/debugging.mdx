# Debugging

In the [Interface](developer-tools/intro-gui) section, it was explained how to view the performance of your code in a real environment using the scene tree and property inspector. This section will not provide further explanations on those topics.

## Viewing Local Logs

There are two ways to view local logs.

### Viewing Logs via VSCode Output

As shown above, JSAR DevTools provides a dedicated output channel to help developers view application logs. Here's how to use it:

1. Print logs using `console` and save them.
2. Open the Terminal panel in Visual Studio Code.
3. Select the Output panel.
4. Choose the output channel "JSAR Scene Logs."
5. Run XSML again.

### Viewing Logs via Chrome DevTools

While the previous method allows you to see independent logs of spatial apps, the Output panel in Visual Studio Code is designed for viewing text-based logs. If you want to view JavaScript objects as you would in Chrome DevTools Console, follow these steps:

1. Open the command palette with Cmd + Shift + P.
2. Enter "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools" and press Enter (make sure you have the preview window open).
3. A Chrome DevTools window will pop up.
4. Switch to the Console tab.
5. Run XSML again.

Using this method, you can interactively view JavaScript objects, but note that it includes all log messages, so you may need to add some identifiers for filtering.

## Real-Device Debugging

JSAR supports real-device debugging in Rokid AR Studio's desktop environment. Here are the steps to follow:

First, open the desktop's quick settings and select "Settings."

In the settings, select "Developer Options" and enable "Spatial App Debugging."

Then, swipe down one screen on the application list to see that the current spatial app is in debugging mode.

Next, open any spatial app project using Visual Studio Code, and you can install the project on the device and debug it in two ways:

1. Open the command palette with Cmd + Shift + P, enter "JSAR: Install to Connected Device," and follow the prompts to select the device.
2. In the Explorer panel, right-click in a blank area, select "JSAR: Install to Connected Device," and follow the prompts to select the device.

Note: This feature depends on locally installed adb to interact with AOSP devices. The basic adb information is as follows:

```
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 34.0.1-9979309
```
