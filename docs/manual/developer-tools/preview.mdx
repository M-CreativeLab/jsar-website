## Interactive Features

In the preview window, several interactive methods are provided to help developers with debugging.

### Rotating Objects

You can rotate objects by dragging with the left mouse button.

### Zooming In/Out

You can zoom in/out by scrolling the mouse wheel.

> Note: There is a maximum value for zooming in and out. If there is no change when zooming, it may be because you are already at the closest or farthest distance. In this case, try scrolling in the opposite direction.

### Resetting the View

You can reset the view by clicking the button on the left.

### Reloading

You can reload the current app by clicking the button on the right.

### Hot Reloading

Modifying XSML code or any other files in the project will trigger a refresh of the scene.

> Note: In the future, more precise hot reloading will be implemented using VirtualDom, rather than refreshing the entire page each time.
