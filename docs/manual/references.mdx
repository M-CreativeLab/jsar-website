# References

In this chapter, we will provide a list of references, the technical documentations and specifications to help developers learn more about advanced features.

## Runtime APIs

JSAR is a Web runtime, and it provides a set of APIs that follow the Web platform standards, such as DOM, WebGL, WebXR, and WebAssembly. And it also provides two additional APIs, the one is part of the Node.js APIs for testing and debugging purposes, and the other is the JSAR-specific APIs for the runtime itself.

## Graphics

These documentations will help you to learn more about how the WebGL works in JSAR, and which graphics backends have been supported by JSAR's unified mixed-rendering architecture. And also here, you can find the references about the WebGL extensions that JSAR supports.

- [Graphics backends](./references/graphics-backends)

## WebXR and input sources

JSAR implements the [WebXR Device API][] to run WebXR applications, here you can find the references about the WebXR Device API and the input sources that JSAR supports.

- [WebXR basis](./references/webxr-basis)
- [WebXR input sources](./references/webxr-input-sources)

## Configuration

There is a set of device configuration that you can use to debug and test your applications.

- [Runtime configuration](./references/runtime-configuration)

## Embedders

If you are a developer who wants to embed JSAR into your application or platform, you can find the embedder APIs and guides here, currently JSAR provides the native C++ APIs and Unity C# APIs to work with.

- [Native APIs](./references/native-apis)
- [Unity APIs](./references/unity-apis)

## Language specifications

JSAR created new languages: XSML and SpatialCSS, and also extends the HTML and CSS to support the spatialized elements and attributes. Here you can find the complete specifications of these new and extended languages.
