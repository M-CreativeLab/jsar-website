# Features

In this chapter, we will introduce the development features, this helps the application developers to learn what features are available in JSAR and how to use them.

## Scripting & Modules

JSAR has implemented the scripting engine (based on [v8 engine][v8]) and module system, which allows developers to write scripts in JavaScript for application development. Based on the above works, JSAR also supported [TypeScript][], the developers can use TypeScript without any configuration and compilation at runtime.

- [Modules](./features/modules)
- [WebAssembly](./features/webassembly)
- [Web Workers](./features/web-workers)
- [TypeScript Support](./features/typescript)

[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/

## Space(3D) Development

JSAR works with the 3d libraries like [Three.js][] and [Babylon.js][], which allows developers to create 3D applications with ease.

- [Three.js Support](./features/three)
- [Babylon.js Support](./features/babylon)

[Babylon.js]: https://www.babylonjs.com/

## Multimedia

Multimedia is an essential part of the application experience, especially in XR.

JSAR implemented the multimedia-related APIs to help developers to use images, audio and video in your applications. And also JSAR provides advanced features to enhance the multimedia experience in space, such as a simplified way to create 3D audio.

- [Audio System](./features/audio)

## Application Debugging

Every application is a standalone process in JSAR, and this process will start a debuging server to provide the debugging interface for the developers. The debugging server is based on the [Chrome DevTools Protocol][cdp], which allows developers to debug the application in the browser.

- [Debugging](./features/debugging)
