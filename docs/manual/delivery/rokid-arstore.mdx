# Rokid AR Store

Through the Rokid AR Store, you can publish spatial apps to the system's desktop space for users to use.

## Development Guidelines

- The package size must be limited to 10MB. If you encounter large models, you can compress them using [gltf-transform](https://gltf-transform.dev/).
- Spatial apps running in the desktop space will be scaled within a 30cmx30cmx30cm cube. Therefore, when developing, pay attention to the size of the models and their internal positions.
- Be sure to comply with the laws and regulations of your country or region, especially those related to content review and distribution. Do not create any content that violates the law.
- Content Guidelines: Ensure that the content of all apps is appropriate and does not include the following types of content:
  - Violent, terroristic, hateful, or discriminatory content.
  - Pornographic, sexually explicit, or obscene content.
  - Rumors, false information, or fraudulent content.
  - Content that infringes on others' privacy, intellectual property, or copyrights.
  - Malware, viruses, or malicious code.
- Performance and Optimization: Ensure that your app performs well and runs smoothly on devices.
- Copyright and Intellectual Property: Make sure you own or have the rights to use all the content included in the app, including 3D models, audio, images, etc. Respect the intellectual property of others and avoid infringement.
- Social Responsibility: As a developer, you have a social responsibility. Do not use the app to spread false information, hatred, violence, or negative values.

## Publishing

> Currently, self-submission by developers is not supported. You need to package the spatial app and submit it to Rokid staff according to the [contest rules](https://s.rokid.com/2tnLB1c) for it to be listed in the Rokid AR Store.
