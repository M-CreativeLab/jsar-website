# Quick Start

In the development of spatial mini-applications, developers have several options:

- By installing the JSAR Devtools for Visual Studio Code extension, you can create projects directly in VSCode and use the functionalities provided by the JSAR DevTools extension for debugging.
- By applying for the Rokid AR Studio developer kit and obtaining a prototype, you can directly develop and debug on the prototype.

This section will focus on how to develop spatial mini-applications using the VSCode extension.
