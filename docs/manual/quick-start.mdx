# Quick Start

To get started with JSAR, you need an XR device or application that insides JSAR, because JSAR is just like [Chromium][], it can't run standalone and need a host application to build and run. The followings are the table of supported devices:

| Device | Status |
| --- | --- |
| [Rokid AR Studio][] | Work in progress |
| [Rokid AR Lite][] | Work in progress |

To help developers quickly get started with JSAR, we also provided an application _Play WebXR_ that uses JSAR to run Web application, images, and 3D models. You can download it from [here](https://foobar) for the following platforms:

- [x] Rokid AR Studio
- [x] Rokid AR Lite
- [ ] Quest 4
- [ ] Quest 3s
- [ ] Pico Neo 3

After you have installed the application on supported device, you can type your HTML URL in the input box to run.

In this section, we will introduce how to use _Play WebXR_ and how to start developing the 3D Web application using the Web technologies. If you are a Web developer but not familiar with 3D, it's recommended to learn from this section.
