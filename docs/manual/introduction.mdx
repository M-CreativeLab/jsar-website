# Introduction

JSAR ([/d í:-sar/](https://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=d%CA%92:-sar)) is a web runtime that can be embedded into spatial environments. It empowers developers to use web-like technologies to create spatial mini-applications that can run independently within a defined spatial context.

- **Embeddable Spaces**: This refers to defining a specific spatial area within the current scene, allowing a single application (space component) to utilize it. Space components can be 3D objects, 2D interfaces, or even 3D objects with a GUI.
- **Web Runtime**: It signifies that JSAR can execute JavaScript/TypeScript code built on Web APIs and also run WebAssembly.

## Key Features

- Spatial Security
- Support for `Web-standard APIs`
- TypeScript Support
- Support for Babylon.js for scene development
- 3D development with Visual Studio Code
- Embeddable within Unity scenes

## Objectives

- Ensure isolation of space components, preventing interference between them.
- Designed with web developers in mind, reducing the learning curve.
- Optimize the offline experience and performance of space components, dispelling stereotypes about web technologies.

## Use Cases

By examining various use cases, we aim to help you quickly determine if JSAR is suitable for your needs.

If you are a YodaOS-Master developer, consider using JSAR if any of the following apply to you:

- You want to create desktop widgets like pets, globes, or stock information.
- You want to develop scenes that combine 2D and 3D elements, such as map assistants or product displays.
- You have experience in web development.

However, you should not choose JSAR if your goals are:

- Developing standalone spatial applications.
- Creating a large-scale game.
- Providing a closed-off user experience.

## Documentation Usage Guide

To facilitate developers' use of this documentation, we provide a brief explanation of its structure so that you can quickly find the content you need.

### Writing Principles

This documentation intentionally includes some redundant content. You may encounter repeated information. This approach is primarily aimed at helping developers understand specific concepts without the need to repeatedly switch between different sections. It may result in slightly verbose writing, and we hope developers can appreciate its usefulness.
