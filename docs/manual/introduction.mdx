# Introduction

JSAR ([/d í:-sar/](https://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=d%CA%92:-sar)) is a Web runtime that can be embedded into spatial environments. It empowers Web developers to use Web technologies to create spatial mini-applications that can run independently within a defined spatial context.

- **Embeddable**: This refers to defining a specific spatial child-space inside an existing space to run a Web application: 2D, 3D, or a combination of both.
- **Web Runtime**: It signifies that JSAR can start from a HTML URL.

## Key Features

- Rendering applications in one space and to be interacted with.
- Supports TypeScript natively, no need for compilation and configuration.
- Supports Web APIs to make libraries like Three.js and Babylon.js work.

## Objectives

- Introduce a new way to use Web application in the Era of Metaverse.
- Designed for Web developers, no need to learn new languages or frameworks.
- Ability to render existing Web applications spatially without any modification.

## Use Cases

By examining various use cases, we aim to help you quickly determine if JSAR is suitable for your needs.

If you are a YodaOS-Master developer, consider using JSAR if any of the following apply to you:

- You want to create desktop widgets like pets, globes, or stock information.
- You want to develop scenes that combine 2D and 3D elements, such as map assistants or product displays.
- You have experience in web development.

However, you should not choose JSAR if your goals are:

- Developing standalone spatial applications.
- Creating a large-scale game.
- Providing a closed-off user experience.
