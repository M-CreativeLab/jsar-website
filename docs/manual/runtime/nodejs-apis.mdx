# Node.js APIs

JSAR runtime is based on Node.js, so in order to consider the ease of use for Node.js developers, JSAR also provides some Node.js APIs for developers to use.

## `assert`

It used to write test cases internally in JSAR, and developers can also use this module if they have test requirements.

## `Buffer`

It is used to enhance the functions of `TypedArray` and `ArrayBuffer`. Node.js Buffer provides more convenient data processing methods, which developers can use as needed.
