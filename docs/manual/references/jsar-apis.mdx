# JSAR APIs

> Currently this feature is unavailable because there is such a scenarios that requires JSAR APIs to be used, but we reserve the possibility to enable it when necessary.

JSAR APIs are not intended to be used directly by Web developers. Instead, it is designed for the built-in application developers on system, because JSAR APIs are more low-level than Web APIs.

JSAR APIs are only available for local applications, namely a URL that's a file path or a `file://` URL, besides, the application URL must be configured in the system's whitelist.
