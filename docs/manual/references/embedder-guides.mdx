# Embedder guides

This documentation is intended for developers who want to integrate JSAR into their own applications or platforms. For example:

- An XR operating system that wants to support JSAR applications in desktop space, such as Rokid YodaOS-Master.
- An Unity-based application that wants to inside some of WebXR applications in its own scene.
- Other scenarios that require JSAR to be embedded in a specific environment?

Currently JSAR provides these two embedder APIs:

- [Native(C++) embedder API][native-apis]
- [Unity embedder API][unity-apis]

[native-apis]: ./references/embedder-guides/native-apis
[unity-apis]: ./references/embedder-guides/unity-apis

If you want to create the embedder API for other environment like [Unreal Engine][unrealengine] or [Godot][godot], please contact us at [Rokid Forum][rokid-forum].

[godot]: https://godotengine.org/
