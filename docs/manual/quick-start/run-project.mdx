# Running

In the previous section, you've created a project, but it hasn't been run yet. Next, let's see how to run the project. JSAR provides three ways to run your project:

1. VSCode Extension
2. Web Browser
3. Rokid AR Studio

## VSCode Extension

![screenshot](howto-run-project.png)

- First, open any `*.xsml` file.
- Select the opened tab page, and in the upper-right corner, you can find the button to open the scene view.
- Click the button to open the scene view.

Once the scene view is open, there are two functional buttons:

- Reset Position: Resets the position of the scene view to the origin.
- Refresh: Reloads the scene view.

You can click these two buttons as needed. Additionally, when you make changes to project files through the editor, the scene view will automatically refresh.

> Developers can also use the extension for real-device debugging to run your project. For specific methods, please refer to [Developer Tools / Debugging / Real-Device Debugging](developer-tools/debugging#real-device-debugging).

## Web Browser

JSAR provides a scene view that can be opened directly in a web browser to run your project. Use the following URL format:

```
https://jsar.netlify.app/playground?url={Your_XSML_URL}
```


For example:

- Using GitHub Raw: https://jsar.netlify.app/playground?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M-CreativeLab/jsar-gallery-rokid-jungle/main/main.xsml
- Using jsDelivr: https://jsar.netlify.app/playground?url=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/M-CreativeLab/jsar-gallery-rokid-jungle@main/main.xsml

JSAR Playground also supports running your local project, but you need to start an HTTP server locally. For example:

```
$ npm install serve -g
```

After installing `serve`, navigate to your project directory and run:

```
$ serve -p 8080 --cors
```


> Note: Be sure to add the `--cors` parameter, as there may be cross-origin access issues without it. This is because the localhost domain and the jsar.netlify.app domain are different.

Then, verify if your service is running correctly by accessing `http://localhost:8080/main.xsml` through your browser. It should display the following XML content:

```xml
<xsml version="1.0">
  <head>
    <title>Poker</title>
    <script src="./lib/main.ts"></script>
  </head>
  <space>
  </space>
</xsml>
```

The specific path may vary depending on your project structure. If your URL returns XSML content as shown above, you can change the url parameter to the XSML address of your local HTTP server, such as:

- https://jsar.netlify.app/playground?url=http://localhost:8080/main.xsml
