# Write your first XSML

[XSML][] is a new markup language used to describe the interface and interactive logic, similar to HTML. To initialize an [XSML][] project in various ways, including:

- Creating a project using [npm][] commands locally.
- Creating a project from GitHub template.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites.

### Install Node.js

> If you already have Node.js installed, you can skip this step.

Go to https://nodejs.org/ to download and install Node.js.

After a successful installation, check the [Node.js][] and [npm][] versions using the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

> Ensure that your Node.js version is greater than or equal to 18.0.0, or choose the latest LTS version.

## Create via npm

Developers can create a project using npm after installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm init @yodaos-jsar/widget
```

This command initializes the project by performing the following steps:

- Downloads the latest template project from [M-CreativeLab/template-for-jsar-widget](https://github.com/M-CreativeLab/template-for-jsar-widget).
- Updates the project name in the `package.json` file based on your input.

After running the command successfully, you will have a `package.json` file. Here's an example of how to configure it:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "jsar-gallery-rokid-jungle",
  "displayName": "Rokid Jungle",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "The mstudio gallery for JSAR",
  "main": "main.xsml",
  "files": [
    "icon.png",
    "main.xsml",
    "lib/*.ts",
    "model/foobar.glb"
  ],
  "icon3d": {
    "base": "./model/foobar.glb"
  },
  "author": "your name and email",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@yodaos-jsar/types": "^1.4.0"
  }
}
```

After successfully initializing the project, you need to install dependencies to enable type checking and auto-completion during development:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the type definition files for space widgets, allowing you to benefit from type checking and auto-completion during development.

## Create via GitHub Template

> If you prefer to create a project locally, you can skip this section.

Open [M-CreativeLab/template-for-jsar-widget](https://github.com/M-CreativeLab/template-for-jsar-widget) and click the "Use this template" button to create a new GitHub project.

![use this template](./howto-use-github-template-01.png)

Click the "Create repository from template" button to start creating a new GitHub project. Alternatively, you can click [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=template-for-jsar-widget&template_owner=M-CreativeLab) directly.

![use this template](./howto-use-github-template-02.png)

As shown in the image above, fill in the required information to create a new GitHub project. The created project will be a JSAR space widget project and will contain files from our template project. Here are some projects created using GitHub Templates:

- https://github.com/M-CreativeLab/jsar-gallery-solar-system
- https://github.com/M-CreativeLab/jsar-gallery-flatten-lion

> For JSAR space widget projects created through GitHub, we recommend adding the "jsar-widget" topic to your project. This will make it easier for the JSAR development team and the community to discover your project on [GitHub #jsar-widget](https://github.com/topics/jsar-widget).

## Project Structure

Whether created through npm or GitHub Template, the project structure remains consistent.

```
.
├── lib
│   └── index.ts
├── model
│   └── foobar.glb
├── icon.png
├── main.xsml
├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json
```

Where:

- The `lib` directory is generally used to store script files, such as `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, etc.
- The `model` directory is generally used to store model files, such as `glTF`, `glb`, etc.
- `icon.png` is the icon file for the mini-program. The YodaOS Master system in the store and the mini-program list will display this icon.
- `main.xsml` is the entry file for the mini-program. It is an XSML file used to describe the interface and interactive logic of the mini-program.

The above files and directories are recommended names and locations, but not mandatory. Developers can adjust them according to their preferences, such as changing the `lib` directory to `src`, the `model` directory to `assets`, etc.

The [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) is the TypeScript configuration file, used to configure the behavior of the TypeScript compiler and VSCode's intelligent suggestions.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "types": [
      "@yodaos-jsar/types"
    ]
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

> Projects created from the template already include the `tsconfig.json` file. Developers can modify the configuration according to their needs, but it is generally not recommended.

The [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) is the standard configuration file for every npm project. JSAR extends the npm package.json specification, and here is a complete explanation within JSAR:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Project name, must be in lowercase letters and may include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces. |
| `displayName` | string | Yes | Project display name, can include Chinese characters. |
| `version` | string | Yes | Project version number, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Project description. |
| `main` | string | Yes | Project entry file, must be an xsml file. |
| `files` | string[] | Yes | Project file list, including xsml files, icon images, model files, etc. Only files or folders added to the `files` field will be packaged into the JSAR space mini-program. |
| `icon3d` | object | Yes | 3D icon configuration for the project, including `base` and `size` fields. `base` is the model file path, and `size` is the size of the model file in meters. |
| `author` | string | No | Project author, can include name and email. |
| `license` | string | No | Project license, following the [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) guidelines. |
| `devDependencies` | object | No | Project development dependencies, including `@yodaos-jsar/types`, which contains type definition files for JSAR space mini-programs. |

Important notes:

1. The `name` field must consist of lowercase letters and does not support [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scope). For example, `@rokid/jsar-gallery-rokid-jungle` is not supported.
2. The `main` field must point to an xsml file and does not support JavaScript files.
3. The `files` field must include xsml files and `icon.png`, which is used for display in the store and the list of mini-programs.
4. Be sure to add the `@yodaos-jsar/types` dependency. It contains type definition files for space mini-programs, enabling type checking and autocompletion during development.

## Next

Now you have learned how to write both HTML and XSML projects.

The next step is to learn how to run these in the JSAR integrated application, in next section, we will show you how to use the _Play WebXR_ application to run your project.
