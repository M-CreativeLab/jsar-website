# Setup

To get started with JSAR, you need to get the followings ready:

- Install the _Play WebXR_ app(`.apk`) on your supported device: [Rokid AR Studio][] or [Rokid AR Lite][].
- Create a common Web project, in simplest, just create a `index.html` file with some HTML content.

[Rokid AR Studio]: https://arstudio.rokid.com/
[Rokid AR Lite]: https://arlite.rokid.com/

## Install _Play WebXR_

_Play WebXR_ is an [Unity][] application that can run on [Rokid AR Studio][] and [Rokid AR Lite][]. You can download the latest application via the following ways:

- Get the app from the app store on device.
- Download the latest `.apk` from [here](http://ar.rokidcdn.com/web-assets/yodaos-jsar/PlayWEBXR.apk) and install it manually via adb.

When you have an installed _Play WebXR_ in your device and open it, then you will be guided to a standalone space created by _Play WebXR_, and like every Web browser does, there is an input box for you to input the URL you want to run.

## URL types supported

Just like a Web browser can open an image, a video, a PDF file, etc., JSAR can open kinds of URLs, including.

### Images

When a URL ends with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, it will be treated as an image and displayed on a virtual screen in the space.

### 3D Models

Currently only `.glb` and `.gltf` files are supported as 3D models, when user type this kind of URL, a 3D model will be rendered in the space with a scaled size.

### HTML

When a URL ends with `.html`, it will be treated as a [HTML][] file and run in the space.

### XSML

[XSML][] is introduced by former version of JSAR, it's a HTML-like markup language to represent a 3D object, but it's not recommended to use it anymore because HTML can do the same thing now.

## Next

In next section, we will start from writing a simple HTML.
